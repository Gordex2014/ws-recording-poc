Video recording POC using web sockets and Buffer chunks.

## Installation

    If you don't have yarn installed, run the following command:

    $ npm i -g yarn

    Go to the backend folder:

    $ cd backend

    Install the dependencies:

    $ yarn

    Run the server:

    $ yarn start:dev

    In a new terminal, go to the frontend folder:

    $ cd frontend

    install the dependencies:

    $ yarn

    Run the app:

If you want to access the server from another device, you need to change the host in the frontend/src/constants/api.ts file.
